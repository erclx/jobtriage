# Readme reference

## Structure

- H1 title, H2 major sections, H3 subsections. Maintain proper hierarchy for GitHub's auto-generated table of contents.
- Use sentence case for all headings (proper nouns and product names retain their casing)
- Project description in plain text directly under H1. Keep it to 2-3 sentences.
- Do not create deeply nested heading structures that harm scannability
- Do not use horizontal rules or dividers (`---`)

## Sections

- Required: project description, installation/setup, usage examples, support/help resources
- Optional: badges (at top, before description), features, contributing (link to `CONTRIBUTING.md`), license (link to `LICENSE`)
- Do not include full API documentation. Link to separate docs instead.
- Do not include license text. Reference the `LICENSE` file.
- Do not include detailed contribution guidelines. Reference `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
- Do not include extensive troubleshooting guides. Use a wiki or separate documentation.

## Content

- Open public-facing READMEs with universal problems any reader recognizes, not repo-specific artifact names. Save artifact names for feature or "What is inside" sections.
- Use relative paths for repository files. Use absolute URLs for external resources.
- Include practical usage snippets for core functionality
- For libraries/tools: include API quickstart
- For applications/products: include usage instructions and configuration options
- For CLI tools: include command examples with flags
