subtitle: Ollama-compatible open-source models for tool-calling agent loops on a 32 GB GPU
---

Snapshot of the Ollama library and tool-calling benchmarks as of early 2026, sized for a workstation with one RTX-class 32 GB GPU running an agent loop with `num_ctx=8192`. Updated when a new model swap lands.

## VRAM budgeting

The KV cache at 8192 context on a typical 24-32B model adds 1-2 GB on top of the weights. Stay under 24 GB total to leave headroom for prompt processing, vision encoders, and the system. WSL2 hosts must additionally watch Windows-side RAM, since Ollama's stock 131k context window allocates a KV cache that spills past the WSL memory cap into Windows host RAM under inference.

## Candidates

## Per-model sampling defaults

Each family ships with different recommended sampling settings. Carrying one family's settings across a swap is a common cause of regressions on chitchat discipline and tool-selection accuracy.

| Model family          | Recommended sampling                                                                |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Gemma 4               | `temperature=1.0, top_p=0.95, top_k=64`                                             |
| Mistral Small 3.2     | `temperature ~0.15`                                                                 |
| Qwen 3 (all variants) | `temperature=0.7`                                                                   |
| Qwen 3 Coder          | special instruction-tuned tool-call template, do not reuse on other Qwen 3 variants |

The chat route handler currently passes only `num_ctx` through `providerOptions.ollama.options` and lets the provider apply defaults. Add per-model sampling overrides only if smoke shows a regression.

## Integration gotchas

### Thinking-mode hygiene

Models with reasoning channels (Qwen 3 thinking variants, Gemma 4 with `<|think|>` enabled) produce internal thoughts in a separate channel from the final answer. `ollama-ai-provider-v2` does not strip these by default, so the thoughts leak into chat output as visible text. Two failure modes seen in practice:

- `qwen3:30b` MoE A3B-Instruct emits the entire reasoning monologue to the user ("Okay, the user said 'hi'. Let me think about how to respond...")
- Multi-turn conversations that include prior thought blocks in history degrade tool-selection accuracy on subsequent turns

Mitigation: prefer non-thinking variants (Mistral, Gemma 4 without the `<|think|>` token, Qwen 3 with `think: false`) until the provider learns to filter.

### `searchJobs`-style strict-input tools

Models with strong code-generation training (Qwen 3 Coder, Mistral Small 3.2 at default temperature, Qwen 3 32B) tend to call structured-filter tools even when the required inputs are unavailable, fabricating placeholder ids. The fix is at the tool-description boundary: state the input format precisely and validate at the API layer with an actionable 4xx that the agent can recover from. The `searchJobs` tool in this project enforces JobTech's 4-3-3 nanoid format at `JobSearchRequest`, returning a 422 the agent can recover from by switching to `triageBatch`.

### Provider parser path

The Vercel AI SDK's `ollama-ai-provider-v2` was historically tuned for Qwen 3 Coder's specially designed function-call format. Mistral and Gemma 4 use Ollama's standard OpenAI-compatible tool schema and work without provider tweaks. GLM-4.5 envelope format is not yet first-class in Ollama core.

## Smoke harness

`web/scripts/model-probe.ts` runs probe fixtures from `.claude/evals/*.json` against the live Next.js stack with the real system prompt and tool schemas. The harness reads `PROBE_FIXTURE` from env and branches on the fixture's `kind` field. Restart of the web server between models is automatic. Output lands at `.claude/.tmp/ollama-model-research/smoke-<fixture>.md`.

Two fixtures ship today:

- `agent-discipline.json` (`kind: discipline`): 5 chitchat probes expecting zero tool calls plus 3 tool-warranted probes expecting a specific tool from a small allow-list. Default fixture.
- `agent-language.json` (`kind: language`): 9 probes covering English greetings, Swedish greetings, and full Swedish sentences. The harness applies a Swedish-marker word heuristic to detect the response language.

Run a single fixture against a single model:

```bash
PROBE_MODELS=gemma4:26b PROBE_FIXTURE=.claude/evals/agent-language.json bun run web/scripts/model-probe.ts
```

Re-run on every model swap and after any system-prompt or tool-description change. The fixture set is small enough to be cheap (~5 min per model) and broad enough to catch the failure axes that matter most: false-positive tool calls on chitchat, wrong-tool selection on warranted prompts, and reply-language drift.
